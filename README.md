Microbial Community Analysis

May 17, 2021 - May 19, 2021, 9 a.m. - 4:30 p.m daily. **Online learning**

With high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of entire microbial communities we are rapidly advancing our understanding of the composition and functional content of microbial communities involved in climate change, environmental pollution, human health, biotechnology, etc. Using these data we are able to achieve the most complete picture of the taxonomic (i.e., what organisms are there) and functional (i.e., what are those organisms are doing) composition of microbial communities, making it possible to perform investigations that include organisms that were previously intractable with culturing-based methods. With HTS all organisms contained in an environmental sample are sequenced in a culture-independent manner, using either amplicon based methods to investigate the taxonomic content or whole-genome/transcriptome shotgun-based methods to investigate both the taxonomic and functional content of the sampled community. This workshop will cover - the amplicon-based molecular laboratory techniques used to assay microbial communities (lecture only) - the bioinformatics methodologies for analysis using command-line tasks and applications (hands-on) Metagenomics and metatranscriptomics will be briefly covered in a lecture. Not all topics regarding microbial community analysis will be covered nor all potential software resources (Qiime or Mothur will not be covered) as there are just too many.

A basic understanding of the command line and R is a prerequisite for success in this course. We recommend beginners enroll in our introductory courses in CLI and R. After a brief review on the first day of the course,  we will not be providing instruction in basic CLI or R.

This workshop will be held online from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm each day.

Participants must have access to a computer with a reliable connection to the internet, current versions of [R version 4.0](https://cloud.r-project.org/) and [Rstudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) installed, and an application that allows them to ssh into a server (e.g. Bash for Windows, or Terminal for Apple).

### FAQ

**What do I need to bring?** … You will need access to a computer with a reliable connection to the internet, current versions of [R version 4.0](https://cloud.r-project.org/) and [Rstudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) installed, and an application that allows them to ssh into a server (e.g. Bash for Windows, or Terminal for Apple). If your department does not allow you to install software on your computer, please contact us ahead of time.

**Can I bring my own data?** … We will provide datasets for use during the workshop, as this helps to keep the workshop moving. There will be time, however, to discuss your own datasets and how you might work with them outside of the workshop.

**How much does it cost?** … The registration fee is $1,000 for current students, postdocs, staff and faculty at Univeristy of California campus' or UC National Labs (LBNL, LANL, LLNL), $1,200 for other academic or non-profit participants and $1,700 for other participants. We accept credit cards, as well as UC Davis recharge accounts, for payment. We are pleased to be able to offer three group pricing bundle options: 15% off registration for groups of three to five, 25% off registration for groups of six to ten, and custom instructional packages for groups larger than ten. If you are interested in one of these pricing options, please contact us at training.bioinformatics@ucdavis.edu for a custom coupon code.

**How do I apply?** … All registration is “first-come, first-served”. There is no application process.  So, sign up as soon as possible to ensure your place in the workshop.
